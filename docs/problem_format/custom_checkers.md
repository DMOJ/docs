# Custom Checkers

A problem with many possible outputs (e.g. not a single possible answer, with score based on accuracy) may benefit from the `checker` field in the `init.yml` file. A checker is a Python script that is executed per-case post-execution â€” it grades the output of a process but does not interact with it.

The DMOJ judge already defines several checkers.
These checkers are specified as follows:
```yaml
checker:
  name: <name of checker>
  args: {}
```

Where `args` is a dictionary of arguments to pass to the `check` function.

If you do not need to pass arguments, then you can write
```yaml
checker: <name of checker>
```

## Standard Checker - `standard`

If no `checker` field is specified, then the problem will default to the standard checker.

This checker return `True` if the submission's output and the judge's output are equal, modulo whitespace. Specifically, the submission's output and the judge's output are split line by line and tokenized, with lines with no tokens being discarded. For each individual line, the submission's tokens must match exactly with the judge's tokens.

## Easy Checker  - `easy`

This checker ignores all whitespace and checks if the number of occurrences of each character are equal.

## Floating Point Checkers - `floats`

The `floats` checker is used when outputs may suffer from floating point epsilon.

`args` can contain a key for `precision`, indicating an epsilon of ~10^{-\text{precision}}~.
This value defaults to `6`.

Additionally, `args` can contain a key for `error_mode`. An `error_mode` of `default` will check if the process output is within an absolute or relative of epsilon, an `error_mode` of `relative` will only check for relative error, and an `error_mode` of `absolute` will only check for absolute error.

Finally, all non-numeric outputs will be treated as strings, and will be compared for equality.

## Absolute Floating Point Error Checker - `floatsabs`

`floatsabs` is an alias for `floats` with `error_mode` set to `absolute`.

## Relative Floating Point Error Checker - `floatsrel`

`floatsrel` is an alias for `floats` with `error_mode` set to `relative`.

## Identical Checker - `identical`

The `identical` checker will check if the user output and the judge's output are identical, including whitespace.

`args` can contain a key for `pe_allowed`, which defaults to `True`.
If `pe_allowed` is true, the checker will give the feedback `Presentation Error, check your whitespace`, if the output is correct modulo whitespace.
Otherwise, the checker will return `True` if the two outputs are identical, and `CheckerResult(False, 0, feedback=None)` otherwise.

## Line-by-Line Checker - `linecount`

The `linecount` checker is a custom checker primarily used for ECOO problems.

`args` can contain a key for `feedback`, which defaults to `True`.
`feedback` indicates if the judge should give return per-line feedback: a check mark for a correct line, and a cross if the line is incorrect.

## Sorted Checker - `sorted`

The `sorted` checker checks if the submission's output and judge's output are equal modulo their ordering.

The argument you can pass in `args` is `split_on`, which can equal either `lines`, or `whitespace`.

If `split_on` equals `lines`, the checker will return `True` if the two outputs are identical, modulo the ordering of their lines.

### Unordered Checker - `unordered`

This is an alias for `sorted` with `split_on` equal to `whitespace`.

## Custom Checkers

A `checker` Python script must implement a function that is called by the judge:

```python
def check(process_output, judge_output, **kwargs):
```

Variables in global scope will exist throughout the grading process.

`**kwargs` is a dictionary containing

- `submission_source`: the source code of the submission.
- `judge_input`: the judge's input.
- `point_value`: the point value of the test case.
- `case_position`: the index of the test case.
- `batch`: the batched the test case belongs to.
- `submission_language`: the language the submission was submitted in.
- `binary_data`: a boolean, which is `True` if the data was not normalized to Linux line endings, and `False` otherwise.
- `execution_time`: the runtime of the program, in seconds.
- `problem_id`: the problem code.

Additionally, if the `check` method has the flag `run_on_error` set, it will be run against the submission's output, even if it receives an IR/TLE/RTE/MLE verdict.
The only built-in checker that has this flag set is the `linecount` checker.

### Returns

`check` can return either a `CheckerResult` object (`from dmoj.result import CheckerResult`), or a boolean (`case_passed_bool`).
 A `CheckerResult` can be instantiated through `CheckerResult(case_passed_bool, points_awarded, feedback='')`.

## Native Checkers
Sometimes, problems that require checkers may also be computationally expensive.
In such cases, it is often beneficial to move answer checking from the slow Python problem module and into a native language.

This is handled by `bridged` checker.

The `bridged` checker takes the following arguments:

- `files`: either a filename, or a list of filenames, corresponding to the checker.
- `lang`: the language the checker is written in, using the same conventions as the judge.
- `time_limit`: the time limit allocated to the checker. It defaults to `env['generator_time_limit']`.
- `memory_limit`: the memory limit allocated to the checker. It defaults to `env['generator_memory_limit']`.
- `compiler_time_limit`: the time limit allocated to compiling the checker. It defaults to `env['generator_compiler_limit']`.
- `feedback`: if true, the checker's standard output will be shown as feedback. Defaults to true.
- `flags`: compilation flags to pass to the checker.
- `cached`: if true, the checker's binary will be cached for performance. Defaults to true.
- `type`: specifies the arguments to pass the checker and how to interpret the checker's return code and output.
  - The `default` type passes the arguments in the order `input_file output_file judge_file`. A return code of `0` is an AC, `1` is a WA, and anything else results in an internal error.
  - The `testlib` type passes the arguments in the order `input_file output_file judge_file`. A return code of `0` is an AC, `1` is a WA, `2` is a presentation error, `3` corresponds to an assertion failing,
  and `7`, along with an output to `stderr` of the format `points X` for an integral ~X~ awards ~X~ points. Anything else results in an internal error.
  - The `coci` type behaves similarly to the `testlib` type, but has partial format `partial X/Y`, which awards ~\frac X Y~ of the points.
  - The `peg` type exists for compatibility with the WCIPEG judge.

The files will be compiled and sandboxed, then executed with the arguments `input_file`, `output_file`, and `judge_file`, which are files containing input, submission output, and judge output, respectively.

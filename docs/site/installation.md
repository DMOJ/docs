## Installing the prerequisites

```
$ apt install git gcc g++ make python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev gettext curl
$ wget -q --no-check-certificate -O- https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | sudo python
$ pip install virtualenv
$ wget -O- https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
$ apt install nodejs
$ npm install -g sass pleeease-cli
```

## Creating the database

Next, we will set up the database using MariaDB. The DMOJ is only tested to work with MySQL, and it is unlikely to work with anything else. Please visit [the MariaDB site](https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/repositories/) and follow the download instructions.

When asked, you should select the latest MariaDB version.

```
$ apt update
$ apt install mariadb-server libmysqlclient-dev
```

You will required to create a root password for MariaDB. It's a good idea to remember it!

Next, we should set up the database itself. You will be asked for the root password you just set, after which you should execute the commands listed below to create the necessary database.

```
$ mysql -uroot -p
mariadb> CREATE DATABASE dmoj DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;
mariadb> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dmoj.* to 'dmoj'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
mariadb> exit
```

## Installing prerequisites

Now that you are done, you can start installing the site. First, create a `virtualenv` and activate it. Here, we'll create a `virtualenv` named `dmojsite`.

```
$ virtualenv dmojsite
$ . dmojsite/bin/activate
```
You should see `(dmojsite)` prepended to your shell. Henceforth, `(dmojsite)` commands assumes you are in the code directory, with `virtualenv` active.

!!! note
    The `virtualenv` will help keep the modules needed separate from the system package manager, and save you many headaches when updating. Read more about `virtualenv`s [here](#).


Now, fetch the site source code.

```
(dmojsite) $ git clone https://github.com/DMOJ/site.git
(dmojsite) $ cd site
(dmojsite) $ git submodule init
(dmojsite) $ git submodule update
```

Install Python dependencies into the `virtualenv`.

```
(dmojsite) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
(dmojsite) $ pip install mysqlclient
```

You will now need to configure `dmoj/local_settings.py`. You should make a copy [of this sample settings file](https://github.com/DMOJ/docs/blob/master/sample_files/local_settings.py) and read through it, making changes as necessary. Most importantly, you will want to update MariaDB credentials.

!!! note
    Leave debug mode on for now; we'll disable it later after we've verified that the site works.
    
    Generally, it's recommended that you add your settings in `dmoj/local_settings.py` rather than modifying `dmoj/settings.py` directly. `settings.py` will automatically read `local_settings.py` load it, so write your configuration there.

Now, you should verify that everything is going according to plan.

```
(dmojsite) $ python manage.py check
```

## Compiling assets
DMOJ uses `sass` and `pleeease` to generate the site stylesheets. DMOJ comes with a `make_style.sh` script that may be ran to compile and optimize the stylesheets.

```
(dmojsite) $ ./make_style.sh
```

Now, collect static files into `STATIC_ROOT` as specified in `dmoj/local_settings.py`.

```
(dmojsite) $ python manage.py collectstatic
```

You will also need to generate internationalization files.

```
(dmojsite) $ python manage.py compilemessages
(dmojsite) $ python manage.py compilejsi18n
```

## Setting up database tables
We must generate the schema for the database, since it is currently empty.

```
(dmojsite) $ python manage.py migrate
```

Next, load some initial data so that your install is not entirely blank.

```
(dmojsite) $ python manage.py loaddata navbar
(dmojsite) $ python manage.py loaddata language_small
(dmojsite) $ python manage.py loaddata demo
```

You should create an admin account with which to log in initially.

```
(dmojsite) $ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Running the server
At this point, you should attempt to run the server, and see if it all works.

```
(dmojsite) $ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

You should Ctrl-C to exit after verifying.

!!! danger
    **Do not use `runserver` in production!**

    We will set up a proper webserver using nginx and uWSGI soon.

You should also test to see if `bridged` runs.

```
(dmojsite) $ python manage.py runbridged
```

If there are no errors after about 10 seconds, it probably works.
You should Ctrl-C to exit.

## Setting up uWSGI
`runserver` is insecure and not meant for production workloads, and should not be used beyong testing.
In the rest of this guide, we will be installing `uwsgi` and `nginx` to serve the site, using `supervisord`
to keep `site` and `bridged` running. It's likely other configurations may work, but they are unsupported.

First, copy our `uwsgi.ini` ([link](https://github.com/DMOJ/docs/blob/master/sample_files/uwsgi.ini)). You should change the paths to reflect your install.

You need to install `uwsgi`.

```
(dmojsite) $ pip install uwsgi
```

To test, run:

```
(dmojsite) $ uwsgi --ini uwsgi.ini
```

If it says workers are spawned, it probably works.
You should Ctrl-C to exit.

## Setting up supervisord
You should now install `supervisord` and configure it.

```
$ apt install supervisor
```

Copy our `site.conf` ([link](https://github.com/DMOJ/docs/blob/master/sample_files/site.conf)) to `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/site.conf`, `bridged.conf` ([link](https://github.com/DMOJ/docs/blob/master/sample_files/bridged.conf)) to `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/bridged.conf`, and fill in the fields.

Next, reload `supervisord` and check that the site and bridge have started.

```
$ supervisorctl update
$ supervisorctl status
```

If both processes are running, everything is good! Otherwise, peek at the logs and see what's wrong.

## Setting up nginx
Now, it's time to set up `nginx`.

```
$ apt install nginx
```

You should copy the sample `nginx.conf` ([link](https://github.com/DMOJ/docs/blob/master/sample_files/nginx.conf)), edit it and place it in wherever it is supposed to be for your nginx install.

!!! note
    Typically, `nginx` site files are located in `/etc/nginx/conf.d`.
    Some installations might place it at `/etc/nginx/sites-available` and require a symlink in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`.

Next, check if there are any issues with your nginx setup.

```
$ nginx -t
```

If not, reload the `nginx` configuration.

```
$ service nginx reload
```

You should be good to go. Visit the site at where you set it up to verify.

If it does not work, check `nginx` logs and `uwsgi` log `stdout`/`stderr` for details.

!!! note
    Now that your site is installed, remember to set `DEBUG` to `False` in
    `local_settings`. Leaving it `True` is a security risk.

## Configuration of event server
Create `config.js`. This assumes you use `nginx`, or there be dragons.
You may need to shuffle ports if they are already used.

```
(dmojsite) $ cat > websocket/config.js
module.exports = {
    get_host: '127.0.0.1',
    get_port: 15100,
    post_host: '127.0.0.1',
    post_port: 15101,
    http_host: '127.0.0.1',
    http_port: 15102,
    long_poll_timeout: 29000,
};
```

`get_port` should be the same as the port for `/event/` in `nginx.conf`
`http_port` should be the same as the port for `/channels/` in `nginx.conf`
`post_port` should be the same as the port in `EVENT_DAEMON_POST` in `local_settings`.
You need to configure `EVENT_DAEMON_GET` and `EVENT_DAEMON_POLL`.
You need to uncomment the relevant section in the `nginx` configuration.

Need to install the dependencies.

```
(dmojsite) $ npm install qu ws simplesets
(dmojsite) $ pip install websocket-client
```

Now copy `wsevent.conf` ([link](https://github.com/DMOJ/docs/blob/master/sample_files/wsevent.conf)) to `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/wsevent.conf`, changing paths, and then update supervisor and nginx.

```
$ supervisorctl update
$ supervisorctl restart bridged
$ supervisorctl restart site
$ service nginx restart
```

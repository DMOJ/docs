# API

The DMOJ supports a simple JSON API for accessing most data used by the backend. Access to the API makes use of API tokens.

## API tokens

The DMOJ supports API tokens for accessing the majority of the site as your native user. The admin portion of the site is left intentionally inaccessible with these tokens. You may generate an API token on your *Edit profile* page. To use, include the following header with every request where `<API Token>` is your API token:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <API Token>
```

### Error responses

The following error codes may be returned by the API token authentication layer. Note that the site itself may return other codes not listed here or identical codes with different error messages, so read the error messages carefully.

- `400 Invalid authorization header` - The **header** you provided is invalid. Make sure it matches the following regex: `Authorization: Bearer ([a-zA-Z0-9_-]{48})`
- `401 Invalid token` - The **token** you provided is invalid. Make sure it matches the one on your *Edit profile* page.
- `403 Admin inaccessible` - You are trying to access the inaccessible admin portion of the site.

## Rate limiting

**90 requests per minute**

If you exceed this limit, you will be captcha'd. Captchas are automatically removed after 3 days. However, note that if you are captcha'd again within this 3 day period, the 3 day counter will reset.

**Note**: This is only a feature on the [DMOJ site](https://dmoj.ca).

## Format

All responses are of the following structure:

```json
{
    "api_version": "2.0",
    "method": "<HTTP method that was used>",
    "fetched": "<time that the request was made in ISO format>",
    "data": "<rest of the data>",
    "error": "<any errors that were encountered>"
}
```

It is guaranteed that only one of `data` or `error` will be in the response.

### Error format

```json
{
    "error": {
        "code": "<HTTP status code>",
        "message": "<error message>"
    }
}
```

### Data format

The data format differs depending on the endpoint called. For endpoints that respond with a single object:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "object": "<object data>"
    }
}
```

For endpoints that respond with a list of objects:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "current_object_count": "<number of objects in the current page>",
        "objects_per_page": "<maximum number of objects that will ever appear on a single page>",
        "total_objects": "<total number of objects in the list>",
        "page_index": "<the current page's index, one indexed>",
        "total_pages": "<total number of pages>",
        "objects": [
            "<list of object data>"
        ]
    }
}
```

### Filtering

Most of the API endpoints support filtering via query parameters. There are two types of filtering that are supported, basic filtering and list filtering. Basic filtering allows filtering for a single value, while list filtering allows filtering for a group of values. Each endpoint describes the filtering that it supports, with the name in a codeblock being the query parameter name.

Example of basic filtering: `/api/v2/problems?partial=True` - This will only return problems with partial points enabled.

Example of list filtering: `/api/v2/problems?organization=1&organization=2&type=Implementation` - This will only return problems (private to organizations 1 OR 2) AND (problem type is Implementation).

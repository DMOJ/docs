# Supported Languages

The DMOJ supports grading in [56 languages](https://github.com/DMOJ/judge-server/tree/master/dmoj/executors): Ada, Assembly (x64), Assembly (x86), AWK, Brainf**k, C#, C++03/11/14/17, C, C11, Clang++, Clang, COBOL, CoffeeScript, D, Dart, F#, Forth, Fortran, Go, Groovy, Haskell, INTERCAL, Java 8/9/10/11, Kotlin, Lisp, Lua, NASM, NASM64, OCaml, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Pike, Prolog, PyPy 2/3, Python 2/3, Racket, Ruby 2, Rust, Scala, Scheme, Sed, Swift, TCL, Text, Turing, V8 JavaScript, Visual Basic. All these languages are tested in production on [https://dmoj.ca](https://dmoj.ca).

As it stands, some languages are used more than others in the scope of competitive programming, so some executors have been tested more than others. As a result, they are more likely to be bug-free than the rest. Below is a list of the most used languages which we run live, along with the number of submissions in those languages as of April 5, 2020.
